## Rogue (class)

The rogue focuses on dealing damage to a single opponent in melee range, and controlling
their effectiveness through statuses. He benefits greatly by flanking opponents.

### Always available

* swift: Move up to one square without provoking AoO.
* move: Move up to 6 squares
* standard: attack a single adjacent enemy (+0)

### Reactions: choose one during your turn

* prepared: Your threatened range is 2 - if a non-adjacent foe provokes and AoO from you,
  you may immediately move 1 space in response to perform the attack.
* evasive: you may reactively spend a swift action to get +2 defense or +2 resist
* mobile: You may spend your move action to move one space without provoking in response to
  any action taken. If that places you outside the range of the action, it misses.
