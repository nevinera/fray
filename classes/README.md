## Classes

There are a few roles to fill - they aren't all necessary, but character concepts will be
described in these terms:

* Striker - for *making enemies dead*. Damage is the focus. (5)
* Controller - for keeping enemies from moving around and getting to the squishies. (3)
* Tank - for standing in melee and getting beat on so others don't have to. (4)
* Healer - keep heroes from dying, supply buffs to make them more effective. (2)

### Warrior

This melee fighter can be built as a striker, but is well suited to tanking -
a number of abilities allow him to focus attention on himself and survive doing so.

### Rogue

The rogue is a melee striker and controller - he focuses on dealing a lot of damage,
especially while flanking, and on applying status effects to his target. He is reasonably
good at staying in melee without taking too much heat.

### Druid

A hybrid striker/tank/healer - he can shift into animal forms to perform as a (fragile) melee
striker or a durable tank with low damage (he relies on the threat of disengaging and healing
to keep enemies from leaving him).

## Not Yet Implemented

### Wizard

A hybrid striker/controller - a ranged glass cannon, he can be built with an eye toward maximum
damage, or focus on controlling individuals and groups. A few escape abilities tossed in, because
he is a very soft target.

### Cleric

He is primarily a healer/buffer, but can be built to function partly as a tank as well. Many of
his heal spells are more effective or cheaper when cast on himself, he has solid defense,
and he can avoid a lot of melee-casting AoO problems via an appropriate Prayer.

### Archer

He is a striker/tank, his pet performing as the weak tank. He can focus on improving
and working with his pet, or on dealing as much ranged damage as possible.

### Monk

Combination tank/controller. He is adept at moving and tripping opponents, and many of his
attacks can forgo damage to apply statuses. Solid defense, but needs room to move to avoid
damage well.

### Blood Mage

A healer-controller. Blood Mages *generate* MP by applying statuses to enemies, and spend it
on healing and buffing allies. They have limited damage potential normally, but have several
options that allow them to build up to significant damage against a strong foe or spread minor
damage among a group of enemies.
