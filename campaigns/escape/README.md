## Escape from Ewain's Tomb

This is a campaign for two heroes - it involves many encounters where the objective is to
escape past a group of enemies, retrieve a key, or survive for some length of time. Not all
pairs of characters will have an easy time with this - you should make sure to have healing
and striking capabilities at a minimum.

### Introduction

You are two siblings, treasure hunters and adventurers. Your recent discovery of a previously
hidden entrance to the complex of crypts and tombs under Claredon Castle prompted a quick
trip of discovery and looting. But while you were digging through the accumulated rubbish in
the deepest catacombs, you were set upon by a band of chattering goblins! Goblins never come
this close to civilization - after you handle these tiny maniacs, you'll have some investigating
to do; you're certain the King will wish to know of this.
